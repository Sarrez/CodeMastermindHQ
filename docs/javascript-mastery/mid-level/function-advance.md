## Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions are functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions as results. They provide a powerful way to abstract and compose functionality.

### Definition and Explanation
A higher-order function is a function that operates on other functions. It can accept functions as arguments, return functions as results, or both. Higher-order functions enable you to write more flexible and reusable code by abstracting common patterns and behaviors.

### Examples of Higher-Order Functions
```javascript
// Example 1: Array map() method
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((num) => num ** 2);
console.log(squaredNumbers);  // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

// Example 2: Function composition
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiplyByTwo = (num) => num * 2;

const addAndMultiply = (a, b) => multiplyByTwo(add(a, b));
console.log(addAndMultiply(2, 3));  // Output: 10
```

### Practical Use Cases
- Higher-order functions are commonly used with array methods like map(), filter(), and reduce() to perform transformations or computations on arrays.
- They can be used to create abstractions and reusable code by encapsulating common behaviors in functions.
- Higher-order functions are essential in functional programming paradigms and can enable declarative programming styles.

## Closures
Closures are a powerful concept in JavaScript that allows functions to retain access to variables from their outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.

### Definition and Explanation
A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows the function

 to access variables from its outer scope, even when the function is executed outside of that scope. Closures enable powerful programming patterns such as data encapsulation, private variables, and function factories.

### Creating Closures
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = 'I am from the outer scope';

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const closure = outerFunction();
closure();  // Output: I am from the outer scope
```

### Practical Use Cases
- Closures can be used to create private variables and encapsulate data within a function scope.
- They are helpful in implementing data hiding and abstraction in JavaScript.
- Closures are commonly used in event handling, callbacks, and asynchronous programming.

## Function Composition
Function composition is a technique where multiple functions are combined to form a new function. It allows you to create complex behavior by combining simpler functions.

### Definition and Explanation
Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. The output of one function becomes the input of another function, forming a chain of operations. Function composition provides a way to create reusable and modular code by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, composable functions.

### Function Composition Techniques
```javascript
// Technique 1: Using function composition libraries (e.g., Ramda)
import { compose, pipe } from 'ramda';

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiplyByTwo = (num) => num * 2;
const square = (num) => num ** 2;

const calculate = compose(square, multiplyByTwo, add);
console.log(calculate(2, 3));  // Output: 25

// Technique 2: Manual function composition
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiplyByTwo = (num) => num * 2;
const square = (num) => num ** 2;

const calculate = (a, b) => {
  const sum = add(a, b);
  const doubledSum = multiplyByTwo(sum);
  const result = square(doubledSum);
  return result;
};

console.log(calculate(2, 3));  // Output: 25
```

### Examples of Function Composition
```javascript
// Example 1: Composing functions with array methods
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers
  .filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)
  .map((num) => num ** 2)
  .reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);

console.log(result);  // Output: 20

// Example 2: Composing functions with plain JavaScript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const multiplyByTwo = (num) => num * 2;
const square = (num) => num ** 2;

const calculate = (a, b) => square(multiplyByTwo(add(a, b)));
console.log(calculate(2, 3));  // Output: 25
```

## Recursion
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems.

### Definition and Explanation
Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller, similar subproblems until a base case is reached. Recursion provides an elegant solution for solving problems that can be naturally divided into smaller instances of the same problem.

### Recursive Functions
```javascript
// Example 1: Factorial calculation using recursion


function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0) {
    return 1;  // Base case
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Recursive case
  }
}

console.log(factorial(5));  // Output: 120

// Example 2: Fibonacci sequence using recursion
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return n;  // Base case
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);  // Recursive case
  }
}

console.log(fibonacci(6));  // Output: 8
```

### Practical Use Cases
- Recursion is commonly used to solve problems that exhibit self-similarity, such as traversing tree-like structures or searching algorithms.
- Recursive functions are helpful when working with problems that can be divided into smaller instances of the same problem.
- Recursion is also used in mathematical calculations and sequence generation.

## Memoization
Memoization is a technique where the results of expensive function calls are cached to improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.

### Definition and Explanation
Memoization is a process of caching the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. By memoizing a function, you can avoid redundant computations and improve performance in scenarios where the function is called with the same arguments multiple times.

### Implementing Memoization in Functions
```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};

  return function (...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);

    if (cache[key]) {
      return cache[key];
    }

    const result = fn(...args);
    cache[key] = result;
    return result;
  };
}

function expensiveOperation(n) {
  console.log('Performing expensive operation...');
  return n ** 2;
}

const memoizedOperation = memoize(expensiveOperation);
console.log(memoizedOperation(5));  // Output: Performing expensive operation... 25
console.log(memoizedOperation(5));  // Output: 25 (read from cache)
```

### Benefits and Use Cases
- Memoization can significantly improve performance in situations where a function is called with the same inputs multiple times.
- It is useful for functions with expensive computations or time-consuming operations.
- Memoization is commonly used in recursive algorithms to avoid redundant recursive calls and optimize performance.

## Currying
Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument.

### Definition and Explanation
Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. This technique allows you to create specialized functions by partially applying arguments, which can enhance code reusability and composability.

### Curried Functions
```javascript
function add(a) {
  return function (b) {
    return a + b;
  };
}

const add5 = add(5);
console.log(add5(3));  // Output: 8

// Using arrow functions
const multiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
const multiplyBy2 = multiply(2);
console.log(multiplyBy2(4));  // Output: 8
```

### Examples of Currying
```javascript
// Example 1: Currying with plain JavaScript
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}

const curriedAdd = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
console.log(curriedAdd(2)(3)(4));  // Output: 9

// Example 2: Currying with

 libraries (e.g., Lodash)
import { curry } from 'lodash';

function multiply(a, b, c) {
  return a * b * c;
}

const curriedMultiply = curry(multiply);
console.log(curriedMultiply(2)(3)(4));  // Output: 24
```

## Pure Functions
Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and do not have any side effects. They offer predictability and ease of testing.

### Definition and Explanation
A pure function is a function that always returns the same output for the same input and does not modify any external state or have side effects. Pure functions are self-contained and do not rely on mutable data. They provide several benefits such as testability, code predictability, and ease of understanding.

### Characteristics of Pure Functions
- They always produce the same output for the same input.
- They do not modify or depend on external state.
- They do not have side effects, such as modifying global variables or making network requests.
- They avoid time-dependent behaviors, such as using the current time or random number generators.

### Advantages of Pure Functions
- Pure functions are easier to reason about and debug because they have no hidden dependencies or side effects.
- They promote code predictability since the output solely depends on the input, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- Pure functions facilitate unit testing because they can be tested in isolation without relying on external state.

## Error Handling in Functions
Error handling is an important aspect of robust JavaScript programming. Understanding how to handle errors effectively can improve the reliability and stability of your code.

### Handling Errors with Try...Catch
```javascript
try {
  // Code that may throw an error
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
} catch (error) {
  // Code to handle the error
  console.error(error);
}
```

### Throwing Custom Errors
```javascript
function divide(a, b) {
  if (b === 0) {
    throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero!');
  }

  return a / b;
}

try {
  const result = divide(10, 0);
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

### Error Propagation
```javascript
function performOperation() {
  try {
    // Code that may throw an error
    throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle the error or rethrow it
    throw error;
  }
}

try {
  performOperation();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

## Promises in Functions
Promises are a modern JavaScript feature that simplifies asynchronous programming and provides a structured way to handle asynchronous operations.

### Introduction to Promises
A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

### Using Promises in Functions
```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Data fetched successfully!';
      resolve(data);
      // or reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data!'));
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

### Chaining and Error Handling with Promises
```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Data fetched successfully!';
      resolve(data);
      // or reject(new Error('

Failed to fetch data!'));
    }, 2000);
  });
}

function processData(data) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating data processing
    setTimeout(() => {
      const processedData = data.toUpperCase();
      resolve(processedData);
      // or reject(new Error('Failed to process data!'));
    }, 2000);
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((data) => processData(data))
  .then((processedData) => console.log(processedData))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

## Asynchronous Functions
Asynchronous functions allow you to write asynchronous code that appears synchronous, using the `async` and `await` keywords.

### Introduction to Asynchronous Programming
Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to run independently and concurrently, without blocking the execution of the program. It enables the execution of long-running operations, such as network requests or file operations, without freezing the user interface.

### Asynchronous Functions with Async/Await
```javascript
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Data fetched successfully!';
      resolve(data);
      // or reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data!'));
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function processData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    const processedData = await processData(data);
    console.log(processedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

processData();
```

### Error Handling in Asynchronous Functions
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Simulating asynchronous operation
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data = 'Data fetched successfully!';
      resolve(data);
      // or reject(new Error('Failed to fetch data!'));
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function processData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    const processedData = await processData(data);
    console.log(processedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

processData();
```

## interview questions

1. **What is the difference between function declaration and function expression in JavaScript?**

   - **Function Declaration**: It is defined using the `function` keyword followed by the function name. It gets hoisted, which means it can be called before its declaration in the code.

   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     console.log('Hello!');
   }
   ```

   - **Function Expression**: It is defined by assigning a function to a variable or a constant. It does not get hoisted and can only be called after its declaration.

   ```javascript
   const greet = function() {
     console.log('Hello!');
   };
   ```

2. **What is recursion? Explain with an example in JavaScript.**

   Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Here's an example of calculating the factorial of a number using recursion:

   ```javascript
   function factorial(n) {
     if (n === 0) {
       return 1; // Base case
     } else {
       return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
     }
   }

   console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120
   ```

3. **What is memoization? How does it improve performance in JavaScript?**

   Memoization is a technique of caching the results of expensive function calls to avoid redundant computations. It improves performance by reusing the cached results when the same inputs occur again. Here's an example of implementing memoization in JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   function memoize(fn) {
     const cache = {};

     return function (...args) {
       const key = JSON.stringify(args);

       if (cache[key]) {
         return cache[key];
       }

       const result = fn(...args);
       cache[key] = result;
       return result;
     };
   }

   function expensiveOperation(n) {
     console.log('Performing expensive operation...');
     return n ** 2;
   }

   const memoizedOperation = memoize(expensiveOperation);
   console.log(memoizedOperation(5)); // Output: Performing expensive operation... 25
   console.log(memoizedOperation(5)); // Output: 25 (read from cache)
   ```

4. **What is currying in JavaScript? Provide an example.**

   Currying is a technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking a single argument. It allows creating specialized functions by partially applying arguments. Here's an example of currying:

   ```javascript
   function add(a) {
     return function (b) {
       return a + b;
     };
   }

   const add5 = add(5);
   console.log(add5(3)); // Output: 8
   ```

5. **What are pure functions in JavaScript? What are their advantages?**

   Pure functions are functions that always produce the same output for the same input and do not have any side effects. Their advantages include:

   - Predictability: The output solely depends on the input, making the code easier to understand and reason about.
   - Testability: Pure functions are self-contained and can be tested in isolation without relying on external state or dependencies.
   - Reusability: Pure functions can be reused in different parts of the codebase without causing unexpected side effects or conflicts.

6. **How do you handle errors in JavaScript functions?**

   Errors in JavaScript functions can be handled using the `try...catch` block. The code that may throw an error is enclosed within the `try` block, and any errors are caught and handled in the `catch` block. Here's an example:



   ```javascript
   function divide(a, b) {
     if (b === 0) {
       throw new Error('Cannot divide by zero!');
     }

     return a / b;
   }

   try {
     const result = divide(10, 0);
     console.log(result);
   } catch (error) {
     console.error(error); // Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero!
   }
   ```
