# Basic HTML Structure

In HTML, the basic structure of a web page consists of three main components: the doctype declaration, HTML tags, and the division of content into the head and body sections.

### 1) Doctype Declaration:
The doctype declaration is the very first line of an HTML document and tells the browser which version of HTML is being used. For modern web development, we use the HTML5 doctype declaration, which is simply written as follows:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

### 2) HTML Tags:
The HTML tags are used to enclose all the content of your web page. They define the beginning and end of an HTML document. Here's an example of the basic HTML tags structure:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <!-- Content of your web page goes here -->
</html>
```

### 3) Head Section:
The head section, located within the HTML tags, is used to provide information about the document. It contains metadata, such as the title of the web page, linked stylesheets, scripts, and other important information. Here's an example:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <!-- Other metadata and external resources go here -->
  </head>
  <!-- Content of your web page goes here -->
</html>
```

### 4) Body Section:
The body section, also located within the HTML tags, contains the visible content of your web page. It includes text, images, links, and other elements that users can see and interact with. Here's an example:

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">
    <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
    <!-- Additional content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

By following this basic structure, you can create a simple web page. The head section provides important information and external resources, while the body section contains the visible content.

As a beginner, it's important to practice and experiment with different HTML tags and elements. Start by adding headings, paragraphs, images, and links to your web page. Gradually, you can explore more advanced HTML concepts and elements to enhance the structure and functionality of your web pages.

Remember to always validate your HTML code using online validators to ensure it follows the correct syntax and best practices.

With practice and a solid understanding of the basic HTML structure, you'll be well on your way to creating your own web pages.
