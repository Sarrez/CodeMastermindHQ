# Tasks:

1. Create a basic HTML template with the structure of a webpage, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. Add a navigation menu to your webpage using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`).

3. Structure your content using appropriate heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) and paragraphs (`<p>`).

4. Include images on your webpage using the `<img>` tag and specify the source (`src`) and alternate text (`alt`).

5. Create a form using HTML elements like `<form>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` for user input and interaction.

6. Use semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to improve the structure and accessibility of your webpage.

7. Add hyperlinks (`<a>`) to external websites or other pages within your website for easy navigation.

8. Implement CSS styles to enhance the visual appearance of your webpage, such as fonts, colors, margins, and paddings.

Remember to encourage your users to try out these tasks on their own. You can provide step-by-step instructions, code snippets, and guidance to help them complete each task successfully.
