4. `<address>`: The address tag is used to mark up contact information or addresses. It can be used to provide details about the author or the organization responsible for the web page.

5. `<applet>`: The applet tag is used to embed Java applets into an HTML document. However, Java applets are no longer supported in most modern web browsers, so the usage of this tag is rare.

6. `<area>`: The area tag is used to define areas within an image map, which allows different regions of an image to be clickable and linked to different destinations.

7. `<article>`: The article tag represents a self-contained composition within an HTML document. It is typically used for blog posts, news articles, forum threads, or any other content that can be independently distributed or syndicated.

8. `<aside>`: The aside tag is used to mark up content that is tangentially related to the main content of the page. It is often used for sidebars, pull quotes, or advertisements.

9. `<audio>`: The audio tag is used to embed audio content, such as music or podcasts, into an HTML document. It supports various audio formats and provides controls for playback.

### Starting with the letter "B"

1. `<b>`: The `<b>` tag is used to make text bold. It should be used for stylistic purposes only and not for semantic meaning. For better semantic representation, consider using CSS to style the text instead.

2. `<base>`: The `<base>` tag specifies the base URL and target for all relative URLs in a document. It is placed inside the `<head>` section and helps resolve relative URLs for linked resources such as stylesheets and scripts.

3. `<basefont>`: Deprecated. The `<basefont>` tag was used to specify the default font face, size, and color for text within a document. It is no longer supported in HTML5, and its functionality should be achieved using CSS.

4. `<bdi>`: The `<bdi>` tag is used to isolate a section of text that might be formatted in a different direction or language. It ensures that the text within it is displayed in a separate direction from the surrounding text.

5. `<bdo>`: The `<bdo>` tag is used to override the bidirectional algorithm of the surrounding text, allowing you to explicitly set the direction of text display, such as left-to-right or right-to-left.

2. `<fieldset>`: The `<fieldset>` tag is used to group related form elements together. It creates a visual grouping or container for form controls, such as input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons. The `<fieldset>` tag is often accompanied by the `<legend>` tag, which provides a title or description for the grouped elements.

3. `<figure>`: The `<figure>` tag is used to encapsulate self-contained content, such as images, illustrations, diagrams, or videos, that is referenced within the main flow of a document.
